# Monte Carlo Estimate

This project uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the percentage of pseudo-random points that fall within a specified interval. The program calculates the estimate of the area under a circle of radius 1 centered at (1.0, 1.0).

## Overview

The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that allows for numerical integration and solving mathematical problems through random sampling. In this project, we estimate the area of a quarter circle by generating random points and determining how many fall within the circle.

## Features

- Generate a specified number of random points within a 2x2 square.
- Determine if points fall within a quarter circle.
- Estimate the area of the quarter circle based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
